  # Here we identify the columns of interest in the source file. Each numeric
  # key is the 0-based index of the column. For each column, the key below
  # (e.g., "start_date") is the field name assigned to the data on import, to
  # be used in field mappings below. The value is a user-friendly string for
  # display by the migration UI.
  column_names:
    # So, here we're saying that the first field (index 0) on each line will
    # be stored in the start_date field in the Row object during migration, and
    # that name can be used to map the value below. "Date of game" will appear
    # in the UI to describe this field.
